    <h3>Day1</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>What is JS?</li>
     <ul>
        <li>JS is a single thread synchronous lang. or it is a scriptying lang. that enables u to create dynmic updates content,multimedia control and give the behaviour to html and css</li>
    </ul>
    <li>what is JS engine.</li>
    <ul><li>
        JS Engine is a Software component that executs js script code into the browser. as we have more js engine ut most populer are like crome v8 for google,
        spidermonkey for mozilla firfox and safari for apples.
    </li></ul>
    <li>What are the diff. between var , let , const</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            we have 3 types of declaring a variable that is var let and const.
        </li>
        <li>
            as var is a global scope or functon scope . during memory allocation it is present in global execution context.
            and it can be redeclare or reassigned the value and can be modiefied.
        </li>
        <li> where as let and const are block scope or during memory allocation it is in temporal deadzone. </li>
        <li>and in let we can't reassign nither redeclare the value.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>what is temporal deadzone</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The let and const variables are not accessible before they are initialized with some value, and the phase between the starting of
             the execution of block in which the let or const variable is declared till that variable is being initialized 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>what is hoisting?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <pre>
            hoisting is a process where the program is not executed and 
            only memory is allocated to a function and variables 
            So all variables are undefined as it moves to thr top of their scope </pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>What is arrow function</li>
    <ul>
        <li><pre>
            Arrow function is also called as fat arrow function.
            the arrow function is introduced in es6 
            It allows us to create functions in a cleaner way compared to regular functions.
            if we have only one parameter so we can omit curly braces and return keyword and function.
            and it is easy to read as it syntax is small.
        </pre></li>
    </ul>

    </ol>

    <h3>DAy2</h3>
    <ol type="1">

        <li>What is type of operator?</li>
        <ul><li>
            The typeof operator is a unary operator that is placed before its single operand, which can be of any type.
             Its value is a string indicating the data type of the operand.  The typeof operator evaluates to "number", "string" or "boolean" 
            if its operand is a number, string, or boolean value and returns true or false based on the evaluation.
            
        </li></ul>
     
        <li>== and === diff.</li>
        <ul><li><pre>
        == to campare the value betweentwo variables irrespective of the datatype of variable
        it  checks whether the operand are equals or not.
            
        </pre></li>
        <li><pre>
            it compare & check the datatype of variable if both are
             same then it will gives us bolleans value
            it is strict equals to 
        </pre></li>
    </ul>

    <li> undefine and null?</li>
    <ul>
    <li>  undefined means  a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.</li>
    <li>The undefined value is a primitive value, which is used when a variable has not been assigned a value.</li>
    <li>	The null value is a primitive value which represents the null, empty, </li>
    <li>It can be assigned to a variable which indicates that a variable does not point any object.</li>
 
</ul>
<li>what is NAN</li>
<ul><li>NaN in JavaScript stands for Not a Number. It is the result of numerical operations, where result is not a number.</li>
    <li> It is represented by a special property of the global object with the name NaN.</li></ul>

<li>what is function?</li>
<ul><li>
  A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.</li>
  <li>A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
</li>
<li>
  Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function </li>
<li>Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.</li></ul>
<li>what is anonymous function?</li>
<ul>
  <li>anonymous function are hose funtion which doesnoy have their function name.</li>
  <li>as the anonymous function is stored in another variable and then invoke by  variable.</li>
</ul>
<li>what is IIFE?</li>
<ul><li>
  An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE for short) is a JavaScript function that is immediately invoked as soon as it's evaluated by the JavaScript runtime.
</li>
<pre>IIFE creation and execution.
  (function() { console.log("Welcome to GFG!"); })();</pre></ul>

<li>HIGHER order function?</li>
<ul>
  <li>higher order function are those function which takes a function as an a arguments and return a function as a result</li>
</ul>
<li>What is 1st class function?</li>
<ul>
  <li>First-Class Function: A programming language is said to have First-class functions if functions in that language are treated like other variables.</li>
<li>So the functions can be assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument or can be returned by another function.</li>
</ul>
<li>what is function Expressions?</li>
<ul>
  <li>
    <pre>There is another syntax for creating a function that is called a Function Expression.

    It allows us to create a new function in the middle of any expression.
    
    For example:
    
    let sayHi = function() {
      alert( "Hello" );
    };
  </pre></li>
</ul>
    </ol>

    <h3>Day3</h3>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>what is pure function?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>pure function are those which gives us same output for the same input everytime.</li>
<pre>
A pure function will have the following properties

It depends only on its own arguments.

It wont try to change variables out of its scope.

It doesn't produce any side effects.
 </pre>
      </ul>
<li>what is callback function?</li><ul>
<li><pre> callback is a function passed as an argument to another function

  This technique allows a function to call another function
  
  A callback function can run after another function has finished</pre></li></ul>


<li>what is generator function?</li>
<ul><li>
  A generator function is the same as a normal function,
   but whenever it needs to generate a value it uses the 'yield' keyword rather than 'return'. 
</li>
<li>The 'yield' keyword halts the function execution and sends a value back to the caller</li></ul>

<li>what are operators?</li>
<ul><li>
  operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands.
</li>
<li>as we have 
  <pre>Arithmetic Operators
    Comparison (Relational) Operators
    Bitwise Operators
    Logical Operators
    Assignment Operators
    Special Operators</pre>
</li></ul>

<li>what is clouser?</li>
<ul><li>
  closure are those functions bundles together with environment with reference to its lexical environment.
</li>
<pre>
  function makeFunc() {
    var name = 'Mozilla';
    function displayName() {
      alert(name);
    }
    return displayName;
  }
  
  var myFunc = makeFunc();
  myFunc();
</pre></ul>
<li>what is function currying?</li>
<ul>
  <li>Currying is a technique in functional programming that performs the transformation of a
     function with multiple arguments into several functions containing a single argument in a sequence.</li>
     <li><pre>
      function calculateVolume(length) {
        return function (breadth) {
           return function (height) {
              return length * breadth * height;
           }
        }
     }
     console.log("Volume of the container is:" + calculateVolume(4)(5)(6));
     </pre></li>
</ul>
<li>to delete a character</li>
<pre>str = 'AppDividend';
  console.log('Original String: ', str);
  
  let newstrr=str.slice(5,str.length - 1)
  console.log(newstrr);
  let newStr = str.replace(/n/g, '');
  console.log('After character removed: ', newStr);</pre>

  <li>weakset and weakmap</li>
